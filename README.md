# Smart-Temperature-Humidity-sensor-using-arduino-and-python-program
THIS IS A SMART TEMPERATUE AND HUMIDITY SENSING DEVICE THAT RUNS ON THE VOICE COMMAND GIVEN BY THE USER.   IN THIS PROJECT WE HAVE USED THE ARDUINO IDE AND VISUAL STUDIO CODE (FOR  PYTHON PROGRAMME). AFTER THE UPLOADING OF ARDUINO CODE AND EXECUTION OF PYTHON CODE WHEN AN USER GIVES THE VOICE COMMAND TO THE SYSTEM IT TELLS THE TEMPERATURE AND HUMIDITY OF THAT TIME.  EQUIPMENTS USED IN THE PROJECT: - 1. AURDINO UNO BOARD  2. DHT11 TEMPERATURE &amp; HUMIDITY SENSOR
